# Diversities in the anglophone world

Many different types of things or being included in something : 
=> the social, economic, ethnic or cultural diversity of a country 
A situation where there are many different ideas or opinions about something : 
=> different political or religious ideas (Cambridge dictionary)

## What is culture ? 

Culture is one of the most complicated terms to defined, they are many definitions depending on approaches or theory (philosophy,sociology...)
Culture characterizes the practices and lifestyle shared by some humans beings : language, religions , customs , art/music, food, clothes, sports, beliefs, attitudes... Culture always change/ on the move and depend on people. Culture can be transmitted, learn, borrowed and/or created (sociological definition)

## Cultural stereotypes

Culture is very often define according to specific statements and representations which are not always true or which are incomplete. Categorize people depending on their genders / origins / attitudes. 

## The danger of culture 

Of course the stereotypes can be sometimes funny but they are also many others stereotypes which can be very hurtful and  very dangerous as well. 
The main problem is when people consider that their culture is the only one which is valid as oppose to the others culture (example : the notion of the Western culture).This is part of a tendency call ethnocentrism. 
***Ethnocentrism*** : the tendency to consider that our culture is superior and the only valid one. That all the other culture are strange and inferior. 

One of the many consequences of ethnocentrism, is the rejection of all the others culture groups which can lead to issue in daily life for example issues in the workplace / school / social life. This rejection can take various forms / shapes, negative feeling or attitude = *prejudice* / negative behaviors or actions = *discrimination*. Racism is an example of both prejudice and discrimination. And sometimes ethnocentrism can also lead to fear and hatred of people with other cultures/ origins = *xenophobia*

## Definitions 

Cultural diversity refers to a situation where there are different groups within a society who try to maintain and develop their cultural identities. 
- a sociological reality : immigrants have come to settle in  a host / receiving society (=almost all countries in the world are multicultural)
- a political program : cultural differences are officially preserved and promoted (Multiculturalism in Canada, in Australia)
- an ideology : cultural differences are valuable and should be preserved (different metaphors : multiculturalism, cultural mosaic, salad bowl...)

Salad bowl = refers to a juxtaposition or addition of various ingredients that keep their individual characteristics and qualities. When applied to a given society characterized by cultural diversity, you can see that people are able to keep their original ethnic culture. 

## Integration vs Assimilation 

- Integration : people are bale to adopt the cultural norms of the dominant group culture while maintaining their culture of origin
=> "The Salad Bowl" or "Mosaic" metaphors 

- Assimilation : people give up their culture of origin and adopt norms of the dominant culture 
=> "The Melting Pot" metaphor

## The Melting pot concept 

The USA are often refer as a mixture or a melting pot of people from a wide variety of culture / religion / tradition /  ideas... In 1908, this concept was invented by *Israel Zangwill*  (title of a play) to describe the process of assimilation of immigrants coming to the USA.(affiche diapo)
This concept rely on the idea that everyone who lives in USA can become a part of a larger that is uniquely American. People have left behind their original identity to become American. 

## Salad bowl vs Melting pot

The image of the Salad Bowl celebrate diversity because Americans culture are juxtapose like salad ingredients but do not mixed.
The image of Melting Pot, we can see a mixture or blending of many different people who would become American. 

Nowadays, the cultural trend in the US is cultural diversity (=salad bowl) and not assimilation (=melting pot). 

## Race / ethnicity 

- Race = often linked to biology (people having common hereditary traits), but also linked to culture.
- Ethnicity = linked to culture (people having a common ancestry or sharing a cultural heritage)

But the two categories can overlap because a person may have multiple racial and ethnic backgrounds.


## The colonial period (1607-1776)

- 1607 : first English colony in Jamestown, Virginia
-  New England Puritans (=Pilgrims) : not really willing to welcome immigrants
- Middle colonies : more eager to welcome new immigrants
- 17th century : English, Scottish and German immigrants (in Pennsylvania), and forced migration of Africans (1619)
- 18th century : European immigrants and continuation of African slavery

## The 'old' immigrants(1820-1890)

An influx of immigrants from Northern and Western Europe (British, Irish, Germans...) + Central Europe.  They were farmers, artisans, skilled factory workers and perceived as 'good' immigrants : same culture, same values... They could easily adapt/assimilate to the WASP (White Anglo-Saxon Protestant) model = 'Ethnic' hierarchy

## The 'new' immigrants (1890-1930)

Many immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe: Italians, Poles,
Greeks, Jews, Hungarians... Because of industrialization, great need for factory workers but most jobs were unskilled and badly paid.
Israel Zangwill's play The Melting Pot (1908) = the U.S. would mix all the
different cultures to create a new American people
-> 'Bad' immigrants
-> Tensions and reactions of xenophobia

## The Emergence of Nativism(19th-20th centuries)

Nativism appeared in reaction to the arrival of immigrants whose culture was not part of the WASP culture. Nativism comes from the word 'Native' (=the descendants from the settlers of the 13 colonies). An anti-immigration feeling : nativists opposed immigration and feared for the purity of the white race.
Nativist movements : the Know-Nothings (against Irish Catholics), the Immigration Restriction League, the anti-Asian movements (â†’ the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 banning Chinese immigration)
->Restrictive immigration laws : Emergency Quota Act (1921)

## The Americanization program(20th century)

A majority of people were against Europeans immigrants but also many who want them to assimilate to the American mainstream through the American program. People were taught English, American history, government and American customs. The objective was to assimilate these people. 


## The 4th wave of immigration : after 1965

Immigration seriously decline but everything change with the 1965 Immigration and Nationality act also known as "The Hart Celler Act". That was an act which ended racial quotas. These laws implemented preferential categories based on Family relationship and job skills. These act mark a change for the American immigration policy. After 1970, Immigrants started coming from Asia(Corea/India) and also from Africa. 
After 1980, there was a new tendency, people started to arrive from Latin America. So the population started to diversify a lot with the emergence of new community and new minority coming in

## Linguistic characteristics

Half of the immigrants are proficient English speakers. Spanish is the most commonly spoken language among U.S immigrants (followed by English only, Chinese, Hindi, Filipino and French).

## Hispanics

Hispanic and Latino are ethnic categories, they are from Spain, Central and South America and the Dominican Republic. They have a unique cultural identity called "Hispanicness". the Mexican immigration is starting to decline because of the weakening of US job and construction markets; and new laws that reinforce the border between South America and deportations.

## Asians Americans 

Origins from East Asia, Southeast Asia and South Asia, The 6 largest Asian-American groups : Chinese, Filipinos, Indians, Vietnamese, Koreans and Japanese. Asians earn much more than the average American population. They're also the best educated group as we said there are also socially assimilated what does that mean it means that they are involved in mixed marriages or they live in mixed neighborhoods.

## Americans' perception on immigration

Americans perception on immigration overall again and according to some surveys and studies a majority of Americans have positive views on immigration they tend to say that immigration strengthens the country because of immigrants hard work because of their talent of course there are some differences of opinions depending on political affiliations the the perspective won't be the same if you are a Democrat or a Republican there are also different perceptions depending on the immigrant group generally speaking they are quiet positive views of Asians and Europeans and less positive views of African Latin American immigrants that's reality that's a fact and also Americans are very divided on future immigration levels almost half of Americans saying that immigrant immigration should be decreased while one third said immigration should be kept at present level and just 15% of them said that immigration should be fixed.

# Immigration in Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦
## Founding people

3 founding peoples in Canada : 
- The aboriginal peoples - long before the pioneer arrived in Canada, three majors groups = The Inuit (live in Nunavut) / The first Nations / The Metis 
- French Canadians - different communities among these group = the Acadians (french colony) / The Quebecers / the small French-speaking communities across Canada
- British Canadians

## Canada's immigration policy 

4 main periods :
- Until the Canadian Confederation  : 
	- before 1763 (The french regime)
	- from 1763 to 1867 (during The British regime)
- After Confederation : 
	- after 1867
	- after WWII

## I - Until the Canadian Confederation 

The French Regime (before 1763) : 
France had colonized some parts of the new world, the French domination. People that immigrate during that time were all french. Mainly interested in the Fair trade.Very very few immigrants during that time.

The British Domination :
After 1763, Treaty of Paris so France decided to give up his territories in the New World so end of the French Colonization.
American loyalists remain on the domination of the British to flea the Royal Crown.The beginning of the British Domination.

In the 19th century British and Irish Immigrants still come to immigrate in Canada, *The Great Famine*, all gather by one thing : English. 

## II - After Confederation 

1867 : creation of the Canada that change the population - major change in the labor (many immigrants where call for building projects). Example : The Canadian Pacific Railway (1881-1885) and Chinese immigrants = a really dangerous construction / High rate of death
The Chinese Head Tax that consisted to stop Chinese immigration, only Chinese man (no women or kid), 50$ first but  after 500$ and once they paid it they receive a certificate (slide).This piece of legislation was the first based on ethnic  race. ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³

People on Eastern Europe(especially from Ukraine) come to settle in the West of Canada.
Those people were attracted because they wanted a new life out of poverty, war, etc... They tented to gather and cluster. This is what lead to the *Block Settlements* (small colonies in which people would gather together) . Beginning of the preservation of this ethnic diversity.
Assimilation was the key word of Canada. 

After WWI, people were very suspicious. Nativism revived was still present, especially after The Russian revolution of 1917. People were afraid of being invaded by Communism (*The Red Scare)*. So real slow down immigration in Canada.

## III - After World War II

Things started to change due to Canada needed some workers, labor shortage to fill.  
In the 1950's : promotion of Canada's economic growth : only Europeans were accepted (Italy / Spain / Greece/ Refugees).
Since the 1970's : things have changed a lot, emergence of visible minorities from the developing world. People can come from almost all the part of the world. 

## 1967 : Immigration Act 

The Immigration policy in America were completely revised. Implemented in 1967. These act change everything because it ended racial discrimination as a feature of the Immigration system. These selections is not possible anymore ( racial/national ). From 1967, Immigrants were selected according a system of points, especially according their work skills / their education levels and their language abilities (English/ French). 

As a consequence today , they are three main categories of Immigration : 
- Economic class : selected according a system of points adapted to the needs of the labor market. ( ex : The Skilled Worker Immigration Program ) Training / Education / Languages , *60%*
- Family Class :  when someone is sponsored by a relative already living in Canada. (Recommendations/Reunite) *30%*
- Refugees Class : *10%*, People can apply to have a permanent residence, someone who want to leave his country for many reasons.The most recent were the Syrians in 2016 because of the conflict in Syria.  And also many illegals immigrants who crossed the border between USA and Canada.

## Ethnic and visible minorities 

<u>Definitions :</u>

 **Ethnic Minorities** : People who do not belong to one of the two charters groups or the Aboriginal category and who still retain some elements of their parents or ancestor's original foreign identity ( language, religion, customs...)
 
 **Immigrants** : people who have come to Canada to settle but who have not yet acquired Canadian citizenship (recent/established immigrant)
 
 **Visible minorities** : 'persons, other than Aboriginal people, who are non-Caucasian in race or non'white in color.'' (Canadian Employment Equity Act)
 
<u>According to the last 2016 Census :</u>
- Over 250 ethnic origins reported 
- More than 1 in 5 Canadians are foreign-born
- Almost half of the foreign-born population is from Asia
- Africa accounts for the second largest source continent of recent immigrants
- Growth of the visible minority population(22,3% of the population) : South Asians, Chinese and Blacks
- The visible population expected to grow and represent between 31.2% and 35.9% of the Canadian population by 2036.

<u>Historical geographic  distribution :</u>

- **The prairies :** Ukrainians, Germans, Polish
- **Ontario :** Italians, Chinese, East Indians and Caribbeans
- **British Columbia :** Chinese 
- **Quebec :** Haitians, Italians
- **Atlantic Canada :** Europeans

Half of the immigrants live in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal. The prairies are welcoming more immigrants (job opportunities and high standards of living).

## Linguistic and economic integration of ethnic minorities 

In 2016, the vast majority of Immigrants, like more than 93% were able to speak in English or French meaning that very very few immigrants are not able to speak one of these two languages. Although, the situation is different in Quebec, because it's a french speaking province (official language), so more and more french speaking immigrants were selected in this province of Quebec. The majority speak French but outside Quebec the majority speak English.

<u>Social and economic integration :</u>

Knowing one of the 2 official languages help immigrants to be socially and economically integrate.(French in Quebec and English others)
Many immigrants considered that the social and economic experience in Canada is the best (high education / work experience / freedom / Human Rights / Safety) but finding a job is very difficult.  

But also many immigrants find that finding is probably the most difficult, that's why many of them have reported *unsatisfy economic experience*. Different reasons for that :
- a lack of work experience 
- the language barrier 
- recognition of education / diploma (for example doctors => taxi drivers)

## The birth of Multiculturalism 

Since the end of the 1960's, Canada has been a country characterize by ethnic diversity. In 1971, the Canadian Government and especially the Prime Minister of the time (**Pierre Eliot Trudeau**), officially announced multiculturalism as a policy in order to recognize the cultural contribution of different ethnic groups to Canadian society. 

- So in the 1960's, there was a special commission which was implemented in Canada called *"The Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism"*. The goal of this contribution was to analyze the contribution of others ethnic groups in Canada (the people who were not French Canadian or English Canadian). They decided to give greater recognition to them. 
- In 1971, **Pierre Eliot Trudeau** officially announced a program of "Multiculturalism Within a Bilingual Framework".
- In 1982, Multiculturalism became a constitutional right, it was especially written down in the chapter 27 of *the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms*.(Collective rights)

## The different meanings of Multiculturalism

- A demographic fact 
- An ideology 
- A public policy 

## Purposes of multiculturalism 
- to reduce prejudice 
- to support and encourage cultural preservation 
- to integrate (not to assimilate)
- to promote intergroup contacts and cultural exchanges
- to promote social and economic integration  

## Evolution of multiculturalism

Multiculturalism was launched 50 years ago, so of course the policy have evolved. In 1988, Multiculturalism became a law with the *Canadian Multiculturalism Act* meaning that the aim of this law was not just to preserve cultural identity but also to establish legislation to protect ethnic / racial / linguistic / religious diversity in Canada. The main objective was to eliminate racism, so many programs like the "Stop racism" campaign which were developed to address this issue of racism hatred and discrimination. 
In the 1980's, Politicians were very worried and aware about this situation of inequality. They were also many employment equity measures implemented  to help new comers to help immigrants to get a fair access to employment. 
Others measures were taken for immigration education for example some initiatives were taken to recognize the history of certain groups by promoting black history for example (Black history month).

## The perception of multiculturalism by Canadians 

- Immigration has a positive effect on Canada' (Citizenship and Immigration,2007)
- Positive contribution to the growth of the nation (high educated immigrants)
- Absence/few of illegal immigrants
- Election of Justin Trudeau (Liberal) in 2015

## The perception of multiculturalism by Canadians

Canada : 68%(more things to fit) / 32%(encourage cultural diversity)  
United States : 53%(more things to fit)  / 47%(encourage cultural diversity)

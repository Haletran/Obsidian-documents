# Civilisation Irlandaise (Ireland since the Famine)

Focus on the social economy of Ireland since the Famine in 1845, which was the worst famine in history of the world, it was a social / economical / cultural and human disaster.(8mln to 6mln). Ireland became one of the richest country in the world, grown faster than every country. Fastest booming economy in the world. (2008)

## Introduction 

Ireland was always a place that conquered and colonized. This process was accelerated mostly by religious reformation. 
Henry VIII - catholic king decided to create a new church (change wife) called "Anglicanism church. Later on, his daughter became the Queen "Elizabeth the first" at the end of the century. Led to a long process of migration in Ireland mostly Scotland that led to very violent conflicts.

In the 18th century, the two groups are being influenced by the ideology of "Les Lumières", so they started to get together to create an Ireland State without the England Politics. This movement was called "The United Irishmen", so they start their revolution in 1798 in order to establish their own democratic. But they didn't manage to do it because of the British.
In 1800, the *Act of Union* was signed, which was a legislative agreement uniting Great Britain (England and Scotland) and Ireland under the name of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. And so Ireland will be directly govern by London like a total colonization.

## I - 1845 to 1920 

The real signifiant movement was led by *D. O'Connell* called the Catholic Association, and was against the Aspect of the Union. One of his first demand was to obtain equal voting rights because before they didn't get the right to vote. And so in 1829, the Catholics obtained emancipation and it was a quick victory. Reform of the tithes (la dime), because the Church of England gets all the money so they want to obtain this reform. 
In 1838, the taxes are lower to a certain level(very low). But we are seeing a divergence between the catholics, because they start to have different objectives. 

*Young Island* develop in the 1840's, led by Thomas Davis (protestant). They publish a newspapers called "The Nation". So Catholics and Protestants are brought together to re-boost their celtics traditions. This movement is ready to use force against the British State to obtain what they want. But this vision failed so they not working together anymore. 

The political situation has completly been transformed in the 1840's. 

In 1845, it was a very bad year because of the weather. And potatoes were attacked by a disease called the *Mildew*. People have less food or get sick, so many people died (1mln) and others decided to emigrate (1mln). This situation leave a socio-economic disaster in Ireland.'
A lot of landlords are completly ruined by this famine because the value of their property is worth zero now. How is this possible that the British couldn't do anything to help Ireland stopping the famine ?

**British point of view :**

In Britain, there is the Industrial Revolution, like many country at this period. Agricultural country now become an Industrial country, and also become more productive because of the technical advancements, so that allow more foods production. Land territory with the process of enclosure.
This economic transformation generate a social transformation. 
That led to have two socials groups  before : 
- Landowners (aristocrat) : land his transfers to their members of the family
- Farmers  : use the land to produce food, not their own land

When the society is industrial, the social composition of the British society move in two class :
- Middle Class : (bourgeoisie, protectionism) : they owns the means of Industry, main source of wealth
- Working Class : (working rights)

This conflict between those classes is visible in 1832, when the Electoral system reform the legal taxes limit lower so the middle class can vote ir be elected. In 1834, a piece of legislation called *The New Poor law* was accepted, meant to lower the salary of the Working class for the interest of the Middle Class. 


**Ireland point of view :**

In Ireland, there was not Industrial revolution but very little industry. It remains a very rural and agricultural country.
But instead of having biggers lots, they are becoming smaller and smaller due to the Demographic Boom so more and more people were born so they need to work more. The solution they found, was to subdivide plots to have more families on these plots. So therefore less and less productive, they just produce for they own subsistence. And produce the easiest food to harvest which was the potato (Mono-culture of the potato). Very weak and vulnerable system because if the crops don't grow, you're basically screwed. So a very archaic / non-productive and non-intensive agriculture. 

1845  - Famine

*What did the British state do during the famine ?*

They made decision not very adapted to this problem. Big debate and clash on what should they do and on the Free Trade by the Middle Class and the Aristocrats. *Robert Peel* is a tory, so he defends protectionnist but there are so much pressure on him by the Middle Class that he decided to accept the Free Trade in 1846. So the little quantity of food produce by Ireland is more and more exported elsewhere, but it needed to remains in Ireland for people to eat. 

In 1847, Peel is forced to give up. So Russel take his position. The only help they made will be the *New Poor Law*. They decided that the NPL should only be pay by Irish. Irish property = Irish poverty 
So Aristocrats can't pay because they're bankrupt. So Britain instead of helping made the situation worse than it was before. The Value of the land collapse, so they sell their land to very few people that don't care about agriculture but making out their land later. Either you stare either you die. But you can also immigrate. So the British State tended to aggravate the situation in Ireland. 

So they accept the ideology of Adam Smith called "let the market do his works" (Le laisser faire). With the influence of *Malthus*, the economy is now organized around two main poles : population and food ressources. Things are quite balanced equally. The solution is to bring back population to the level of ressources.

**Consequences of the Famine :**

Consequences of the Famine : Socio-economics impacts / Political Impact / Demographic choc / Disastrous collapse of the agriculture
The West of Ireland is mostly in touched by this situation compared to the East. 

<u>Political Impacts :</u>

*Young Ireland* revolution failed in 1848 but one of those revolutionnary called *Gavan Duffy* thought he need to act politically. So he create a movement called "Tenants Right League" in 1850 to solve the problems in Ireland. They wanted the three F : 
- Fixity of revenue
- Fair rents
- Free Sale (no private property)

In 1852, this movement obtain 40 members in the House of Commons in London. New *Fenianism* movement is also created called *the Irish republican Brotherhood* that want to use violence to get those three F. A movement created at the same time in NY and Dublin, so direct consequences on the Famine. They want to establish their own republic. They create a newspapers declared illegal by the British State called the Irish People. 
So something must be done if you want to prevent the liberation, emergence of the liberal party led by William Glabstone, that propose a political and constituional reforms to solve the situation in Ireland. When he became prime minister, he release the *Land Acts*.

Another movement emerges called "Irish Home Governement Association", that want a new political system to have autonomy in the British State led by *Charles Parnell*.

So we have two kind of Irish in the Parliament. He manages to make them work together and negociate to avoid a revolution in Ireland. Glabstone and Parnell work together to prepare change for Irish people. In 1880, Glabstone became prime minister and propose the *Home Rull Bill*  in 1881 but the majority of the House of commons rejects this reforms because others doesn't want any change, those people were called the *Liberal-Unionist*.
So Glabstone resigned and the Tory government take place but doesn't do anything.
In 1893, Glabstone returned and try to propose again the Home Rull Bill, and once again it's rejected. The British State still hasn't found what they can do to Ireland.

Massive economic reforms by the conservationism to solve the Irish problem. In 1903, a massive reform of agriculture was created called *Wyndham Act*
that allow to buy their land given by the British State. This reform comes much too late because changes took place in Ireland, it's a whole new reality. A cultural movement called *The Gaelic Revival" develop their own things instead of British Culture, so they try to go back to their roots.
"We should have nothing to do with the british" 

In 1905, Sinn Feinn 
This is a complex situation, in reaction of that you have also unionism but within Ireland there is protestant in favor of unionism. One day, Britain will have to negociate with Unionist and the Protestants. Start of the industrialization around Belfast owns by Ulster Unionists. Agriculture is more modernized in the North so something should be done to protect themselves. So radicalism (violence, guns, weapons).

Two groups of people (two parties having separated demands):
- Sinn Feinn 
- Ulster Covenant
  
The British government should do something. In 1914, the British government votes the Home Rule Bill but the application is delayed to the end of the war to avoid problems. In 1916, all the movement decide to organize a revolution in Dublin (*Easter Rising*) that want to overthrow the British State. Failure of this revolution because there isn't enough man and guns. But the British State made a mistake because they went into a very violent policy, kill or exile people of these revolutionary and this revolution is counter-productive.

This fuels the nationalism, so people become more and more republicans. In 1918 at the End of the war, there is a general election with a massive victory for Sinn Feinn. So the situation is completely transformed. So they should find a solution for British State. They declared the Irish Republic in 1919, this is beginning of the War of Independence. (Irish Republican Army)

During the war, the British State passes a new piece of legislation called the *Government of Ireland Act* that make two different systems (Partition of Ireland done during the war) : 
- Northern Ireland created to give a majority for the Unionists 
- In Dublin, Irish Free State with a government and a parliament still under the control

Negotiation with London that leads to a treaty, the *Anglo-irish treaty* that improve the government of Ireland Act. They also obtain a rework of the borders of the borders between South and North of Ireland. The treaty was made by *Arthur Griffin* and *Michael Collins*, and the two Sinn Feinn negotiators came back to Ireland. The party is divided in two parts / sides, they own what they wanted. 

=> Beginning of the Civil War between pro-treaty and non-treaty. The war it's won by the pro-treaty, they create a new state : The Irish Free state. 
Irish can now make they own choices, apply their own policy, economy, they are completely autonomous so that they can take care of Ireland. 

Two Autonomous State with more and more independent and with more autonomy. 
Two major periods : 
- 1920's - 1950's = Ireland doesn't manage to development the economy  (poverty/migration)
- 1950's - today = economic expansion to the Celtic Tiger (modernisation)

Turning point because of a report published in 1958 called the *Whitetaker Report* that proposes to completely changes the economic policy, shift to protectionism to Free Trade. *Sean Lemass* make a different kind of economic policy that were boosted by the Irish membership in 1973 by becoming a member for E.C.C .

Hello everyone, we are going to present you a little literary tour of Dublin that 
we made, that will retrace the life of James Joyce and his books.

<!--Who is James Joyce ?James Augustine Aloysius Joyce was an Irish novelist, short story writer, poet and literary critic. 
He contributed to the modernist avant-garde movement and is regarded as one of the most influential 
and important writers of the 20th century.-->

First of all, you absolutely need to visit *The James Joyce Centre*. Situated in a
Georgian Townhouse, this place is dedicated to promoting and understanding the life 
and his works. Set over three floors, the Centre covers Joyce’s life and work with 
a permanent interactive exhibition on *Ulysses*. They also host walking tours that 
last 90 minutes at around 12 euros.

If you want to take break, there's pubs all around the city , like this one for
instance called *Davy Byrnes*, a literary, heritage and cosmopolitan pub.
(21 Duke St, Dublin) 

You can also visit the James Joyce Tower and Museum. Located in the east coast of 
Dublin, this is a beautiful tower built during the 19th century by the British 
in response to a threatened invasion by Napoleon Bonaparte. These towers are most 
likely known as "Martello Tower". Nowadays, of course, the Sandycove tower enjoys 
worldwide fame as the location James Joyce chose for the opening chapter of 
his masterpiece, ‘Ulysses’. And hold a museum dedicated to the life and works of 
the great writer and visitors from all over the world delight in retracing 
the steps of Joyce’s characters as they begin what is, arguably, the finest novel 
ever written.

During you tour, you can also stop by a restaurant called "The Chapter One", opened 
in February 1992, It is located in the basement of the *Dublin Writers Museum* on Parnell 
Square in Dublin’s city centre. This a one michelin star. The cooking style has a strong 
French influence with a good sense of Irish authenticity through the use of locally grown 
organic and artisan produce, so it's very good. 

You can also go see the historic house that was once the home of James Joyce's grand-aunts.
It became famous because it was the setting of his short story called *The Dead* by 
James Joyce which described it as the "the dark gaunt house on Usher's Island". The House is 
now close to public but you can still watch it from the street. 

There's also many librairies like the Marsh's Library or The Trinity Library for instance. 
Marsh's Library is a beautifully preserved building from the early 18th century, built in the 
late Renaissance amd one of the last library buildings in Ireland  still used for its original 
purpose. It hold many books from Famous readers like Jonathan Swift, Bram Stoker, and James Joyce. 

For your final destination, you can take a look to this hotel called Riu Plaza from Gresham Hotel,
which is a an institution in the city and around the world. This landmark building successfully marries the 
traditional style of The Gresham Hotels with the contemporary style of the 21st Century.

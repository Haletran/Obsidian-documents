## Listen to those songs to understand the Great Irish Famine


The Great Irish Famine represents one of the most terrible event in 
Ireland History. Through those songs representing this era, you're gonna learn more about this irish period. 


### Historical Context

The Irish Potato Famine, also known as the Great Famine, began in 1845 and was one of the darkest periods in Irish history.  A fungus-like organism called *Phytophthora infestans* ("mildew") spread rapidly throughout Ireland. The infestation ruined up to one-half of the potato crop that year, and about three-quarters of the crop over the next seven years. Because the tenant farmers of Irelandâ€”then ruled as a colony of Great Britainâ€”relied heavily on the potato as a source of food.

The infestation had a catastrophic impact on Ireland and its population. Before it ended in 1852, the Potato Famine resulted in the death of roughly between 500,000 and 1 million deaths from starvation and related causes, with at least another million forced to leave Ireland. Deadly and testing, it marked the 19th century with its considerable losses.


### Songs 

I'm going to suggest some songs that I think really represents the essence of what was the famine in Ireland at this period.

* *AmhrÃ¡n na bPrÃ¡taÃ­ Dubha* (â€˜The Song of the Black Potatoesâ€™) :

Composed during the Great Famine by MÃ¡ire NÃ­ Dhroma, who lived near Dungarvan. It features ten verses, and is mostly an appeal to mercy from 
God. Because people were thinking that this famine was a divine 
intervention and it was also the point of view of the Catholic clergy.

It also criticize the system of the poorhouses, which was basically a workhouse so simple farms with occupants dividing their times between and the organisation of the relief system. These houses provided destitute people a shelter and if they want to stay in that shelter they need to work for it.

* *An Bhuatais* : 

A similarly angry song in Irish, highly critical of the clergy itself. It's the story of a Catholic priest who preferred to buy himself new boots rather than take care of his dying parishioners. 

It is also a criticism against the system of the poorhouses and the organisation of the relief system.

* *Johnny Seoighe* : 

It's a a satirical song in the refined allusive poetic tradition of Ireland, which can only be fully understood if one hears the accompanying scÃ©al, the story traditionally told by the singer before singing : 

> On Christmas Eve, the author (probably TomÃ¡s ShiÃºnach from Carna, in Connemara) and his family walked all the way to the workhouse only to find they couldnâ€™t be accepted there for lack of space. They then asked the famine relief officer, Johnny Joyce (Seoighe, in Irish), for help and food, which was denied, and his wife and children subsequently died on the way back home from hunger and exhaustion.

* *Skibbereen - Uilleann Pipes, Jim McKenna* : 

It's an Irish folk song about this context of Famine. Made by Jim Mckenna, a boston composer and piper. And talking about a father and his son history during this period.

* *SinÃ©ad O'Connor - Famine* :

Made by SinÃ©ad O'Connor, an Irish singer and songwriter. And in this song thanks to  her childhood experiences, she blames the Great Hunger on patriarchal power structures and the colonial oppression of the British. A result of the oppression of Ireland has been what she calls the countryâ€™s â€˜massive self-destructionâ€™, its high rates of child abuse, its alcoholism and drug addiction, and the conflict in Northern Ireland.

## Definition

First, we need to define what's a AI, AI stands for artificial intelligence so that refers to system or machines that mimic human intelligence to perform tasks and can iteratively improve themselves based on the information they collect. You probably already have examples in your mind but I can give you more :

 - Deep Blue or AlphaGO

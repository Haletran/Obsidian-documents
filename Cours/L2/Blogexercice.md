# Listen to those Rebel Irish Songs to understand Irish History  

## Songs of rebellion tell the story of Ireland’s troubled history with its more powerful neighbor, Britain, and capture and support the political dreams of the generations who sought an independent nation.The songs that we are dealing with here are just some of those that were sung during the time leading up to, and including, the Rebellion of 1916, the War of Independence and the Civil War.

- *Amhrán na bhFiann* by Peadar Kearney
The song was first published in Irish Freedom in 1912 and quickly became the most popular of the Irish Volunteer’s marching songs. In 1926 Amhrán na bhFiann / The Soldier’s Song was adopted as the National Anthem of Ireland, replacing the unofficial “God Save Ireland”.

- *Easter Rising* by Peadar Kearney
Kearney was a close friend of Michael Collins. When the Easter Rising of 1916 broke out, he was touring with the Abbey Theatre company in England. He returned to Dublin, and fought at Jacob’s biscuit factory. He escaped capture.

After Michael Collins death in an ambush in 1922, he was disillusioned and never took part in politics again. He returned to his old job as house painter.

- *The Foggy Dew* 
Could have went either way for the runners-up medal, but The Foggy Dew takes the spot. It is both a haunting and uplifting tune, which calls for Irishmen to fight for Ireland’s cause in 1916 rather than for the British Empire. Sang by the legend that is Luke Kelly, it is also beautifully played by Sinead O’Connor. 

- "Song about the execution of Kevin Barry" by Paul Robeson
Kevin Gerard Barry (20 January 1902 – 1 November 1920) was an Irish republican paramilitary who was executed by the British Government during the Irish War of Independence.He was sentenced to death for his part in an attack upon a British Army supply lorry which resulted in the deaths of three British soldiers.

His execution inflamed nationalist public opinion in Ireland, largely because of his age. The timing of the execution, only days after the death by hunger strike of Terence MacSwiney, the republican Lord Mayor of Cork, brought public opinion to a fever-pitch. His death attracted international attention, and attempts were made by U.S. and Vatican officials to secure a reprieve. His execution and MacSwiney's death precipitated an escalation in violence as the Irish War of Independence entered its bloodiest phase, and Barry became an Irish republican martyr. 

- *Take It Down From the Mast* by The Dubliners 
"Take it Down from the Mast" is an Irish republican song originally written in 1923 by James Ryan, and published in Leslie Daiken's collection Good-Bye, Twilight: Songs of Struggle in Ireland in 1936, entitled "Lines Written by an Irish Soldier in 1923".Its lyrics refer to the Irish Civil War (1922–23).

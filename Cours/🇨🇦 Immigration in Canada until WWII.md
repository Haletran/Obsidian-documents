# Immigration in Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦
## Founding people

3 founding peoples in Canada : 
- The aboriginal peoples - long before the pioneer arrived in Canada, three majors groups = The Inuit (live in Nunavut) / The first Nations / The Metis 
- French Canadians - different communities among these group = the Acadians (french colony) / The Quebecers / the small French-speaking communities across Canada
- British Canadians

## Canada's immigration policy 

4 main periods :
- Until the Canadian Confederation  : 
	- before 1763 (The french regime)
	- from 1763 to 1867 ( The British regime)
- After Confederation : 
	- after 1867
	- after WWII

## I - Until the Canadian Confederation 

The French Regime (before 1763) : 
France had colonized some parts of the new world, the French domination. People that immigrate during that time were all french. Mainly interested in the Fair trade.Very very few immigrants during that time.

The British Domination :
After 1763, Treaty of Paris so France decided to give up his territories in the New World so end of the French Colonization.
American loyalists remain on the domination of the British to flea the Royal Crown.The beginning of the British Domination.

In the 19th century British and Irish Immigrants still come to immigrate in Canada, *The Great Famine*, all gather by one thing : English. 

## II - After Confederation 

1867 : creation of the Canada that change the population - major change in the labor (many immigrants where call for building projects). Example : The Canadian Pacific Railway (1881-1885) and Chinese immigrants = a really dangerous construction / High rate of death
The Chinese Head Tax that consisted to stop Chinese immigration, only Chinese man (no women or kid), 50$ first but  after 500$ and once they paid it they receive a certificate (slide).This piece of legislation was the first based on ethnic  race. ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³

People on Eastern Europe come to settle in the West of Canada.
Those people were attracted because they wanted a new life out of poverty, war, etc... They tented to gather and cluster. This is what lead to the Block Settlements. Beginning of the preservation of this ethnic diversity.

## III - After World War II

In the 1950's : promotion of Canada's economic growth : only Europeans were accepted (Italy / Spain / Greece/ Refugees).
Since the 1970's : things have changed a lot, emergence of visible minorities from the developing world.

## 1967 : Immigration Act 

The Immigration policy in America were completely revised. Implemented in 1967. These selections is not possible anymore ( racial/national ).
As a consequence today , they are three categories of Immigration : 
- Economic class : selected according a system of points adapted to the needs of the labor market. ( ex : The Skilled Worker Immigration Program ) Training / Education / Languages , *60%*
- Family Class :  when someone is sponsored by a relative already living in Canada. (Recommendations) *30%*
- Refugees Class : *10%*, People can apply to have a permanent residence, someone who want to leave his country for many reasons.The most recent were the Syrians in 2016 because of the conflict in Syria.  And also many illegals immigrants.

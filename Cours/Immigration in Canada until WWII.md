	- before 1763 (The french regime)
	- from 1763 to 1867 ( The British regime)
- After Confederation : 
	- after 1867
	- after WWII

## I - Until the Canadian Confederation 

The French Regime (before 1763) : 
France had colonized some parts of the new world, the French domination. People that immigrate during that time were all french. Mainly interested in the Fair trade.Very very few immigrants during that time.

The British Domination :
After 1763, Treaty of Paris so France decided to give up his territories in the New World so end of the French Colonization.
American loyalists remain on the domination of the British to flea the Royal Crown.The beginning of the British Domination.

## II - After Confederation 

1867 : creation of the Canada that change the population - major change in the labor (many immigrants where call for building projects). Example : The Canadian Pacific Railway (1881-1885) and Chinese immigrants = a really dangerous construction / High rate of death
The Chinese Head Tax that consisted to stop Chinese immigration, only Chinese man (no women or kid), 50$ first but  after 500$ and once they paid it they receive a certificate (slide).This piece of legislation was the first based on ethnic  race. ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³

People on Eastern Europe come to settle in the West of Canada.
Those people were attracted because they wanted a new life out of poverty, war, etc... They tented to gather and cluster. This is what lead to the Block Settlements. Beginning of the preservation of this ethnic diversity.

## Script :

### Intro 

Hello everyone, today's topic is going to be on the assassination of John F. Kennedy throughout the vision of the media. 
First of all, you might be asking who is this person even tho is a pretty famous american figure among everyone.
JFK, in full John Fitzgerald Kennedy, born in May 29 1917 in Brookline (Massachusets) and died in November 22 1963 in Dallas (Texas).
He is a well-known figure of the United States because he was the 35th President of the US (61-63) and he faced a number of foreign crisis 
especially in Cuba and Berlin. But you might know him unfortunately because of his assassination.

On Friday, November 22 1963, he and his wife (Jacqueline) were in an open limousine riding slowly in a motorcade through downtown Dallas. 
At 12:30 PM, the President was struck by two bullets, one at the base of his neck and one in the head. And was pronounced dead shortly 
after arrival at Parkland Memorial Hospital. ([From the Movie Jacquie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYOJ9mXIapg)).

This terrible event was obviously at the center of attention all around the world and depicted in the media. So that's what we are gonna 
talk about during our presentation. Our problematic is "How was JFK assassination perceived and cover in the media in 1963 ?"

#### TV

It is also interesting to see how media covered this news in the United States. Because they have a different point of view, because that's
their president. This event is pretty much embedded in the hearts and mind of this nation. When first word of shots having been fired at President Kennedy's motorcade first reached the newsroom at NBC in New York, they too were unable to go immediately to air because their cameras needed sufficient time to warm up before being used for  broadcast. Bill Ryan, a highly-respected newsman who normally fronted afternoon radio broadcasts and was co-anchor with Gabe Pressman of the Ryan-Pressman  Report , was told to go immediately to the station's 'flash' studio after word had been received of shots being fired at the motorcade in Dallas. Don Pardo, NBC's continuity announcer, broke into the network's programming (Batchelor Father was being transmitted in some parts of the country) to deliver the first bulletin before informing his audience to 'stay tuned to your NBC station for the later news'.

Anchors of both CBS, NBC and ABC were kind of hesitant to officially declare Kennedy dead and continue to repeat that the report is unconfirmed.

dead. 

His funeral procession was also broadcasted on TV. This funeral was televised on the major networks and approximately 41.5 million households so 81% 
of US homes have seen it live. Nielsen (mediametrie) ranks the event as garnering one of the highest ratings in TV history.

The state of funeral of JFK took place during the three days that followed his assassination.
The body of the president was flown from Dallas to Washington DC where he was placed in the East Room of the White House. On Sunday November 24, his casket was carried to the state U.S. capitol by horse-drawn caisson. In the span of of 18 hours, approximately 250,000 people waited in near-freezing temperatures to view the casket. As well, over 1,000,000 people lined up to view the funeral procession that snaked through Washington, D.C. from the capital, to the White House, to St. Matthew’s Cathedral for Mass, culminating in the President being laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery, with representatives from over 90 countries present.

#### Newspapers

- Dallas Morning News 
- The Boston Globe

Everyone of those newspapers have big headlines, with a front page only about this infamous event.

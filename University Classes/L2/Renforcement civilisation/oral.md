# Punk vs Prog 

Hello everyone, today's topic for my presentation will be devoted on the 70's, more specifically on two english youthsubclture, Punk and Progressive Rock. So let's start with a little bit of context.

## Historical Context 

In the years that followed World War II, there was a general economic boom around the world. England enjoyed the boom as well, but that began to change in the 1970s. After experiencing a major increase in British manufacturing, things began to take a turn for the worse in 1973.

The UK went through a major oil crisis after conflicts during the Yom Kippur War, resulting in the major oil company Opec (Saudi Arabia proclamed an oil embargo) putting a halt on exporting oil to the West. Because of this crisis, workers began to be fired, and unemployment was on the rise. This resulted in strikes and high inflation. People weren’t working and prices of almost everything were rising. This was not a great time to live in the UK.

With all of these strikes and protest going on, you can imagine that the police had a lot of work on their hands. At this time in history, racism within the police force seemed to be at an all time high. Civil unrest always brings about change, but in London in the ‘70s, protests weren’t always peaceful. At the end of the 1970s, civil rights riots were happening all over the country, and caused a large divide to occur. 

So, economically, things weren’t going too great in England. But, all of this unrest brought about some major changes in British society, like women’s rights and an emerging Punk culture!

## PUNK 

**Punk**, also called punk rock, aggressive form of rock music that coalesced (merge) into an international (though predominantly Anglo-American) movement in 1975–80. Often politicized and full of vital energy beneath a sarcastic, hostile facade, punk spread as an ideology and an aesthetic approach, becoming an archetype of teen rebellion and alienation.

British punk emerged in 1976, coalescing around the Sex Pistols and spreading – virus-like – into the suburbs, provinces and cities of the UK. Almost from the outset, punk proved a contested cultural space. Its form had American provenance and its point and purpose became the subject of playground/pub/media debate ever after. 

In the UK, however, punk was born from SEX (the shop established by Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood on London’s Kings Road) and disseminated first by Sex Pistols and then by the countless groups they inspired. Punk was presented as a negation of pretty much everything. Because at the heart of the Punk movement was anger. This anger came from the problems with mainstream politics such as unemployment, racism, terrorism, union strikes and inflation. This punk movement defied all that Britain had known up until this point and took a wildly apolitical stance and going against the mainstream in shocking ways was normal on the streets of Britain in the 70's. Young people got active in the community with activities that defied the government. And that's what you should keep in mind when you're talking about british punks because is this idea of a radical new way of life that doesn't involve all that British Law. People began taking to the streets and part-taking in activities that were seen as deviant.

Style-wise, the clothes designed by McLaren and Westwood helped forge an aesthetic of rips, fractures and tensions, capturing perfectly the darkening mood of the 1970s. 
They would wear clothes such as Drape jackets, drainpipe trousers, work-boots and leather jackets held together by safety pins, buckles and zip fasteners and had their hair very short, spyky or sometimes dyed,Shocking mohawks.  

Punk clothing and fashion was meant to be eye-catching and obscure, Grabbing your attention was the main thing punks strived for if their D.I.Y ripped clothes didn't cut it, then the accessories were the second most important thing. These include massive bulky dog collar chokers and any jewelry that feature spikes. 


### Bands

So bands like The Sex Pistols and Ramones created a fire for the British government. With their crazy stage antics, aggressive lyrics and bad language, they rebelled against everything England stands for. "rebellious subculture emerging on the fringes of British Population".

The Ramones may or may not have invented punk rock, but they were inarguably the most important band in punk history, creating the stylistic prototype that would be followed by countless bands who emerged in their wake. The original members were Joey Ramone, Johnny Ramone, Dee Dee Ramone and Tommy Ramone.

So I put one o ftheir most famous song called "Blitzgrieg pop", that came out in February 1976.

The Sex Pistols, rock group who created the British punk movement of the late 1970s and who, with the song “God Save the Queen,” became a symbol of the United Kingdom’s social and political turmoil (agitation). The original members were vocalist Johnny Rotten, guitarist Steve Jones, drummer Paul Cook, and bassist Glen Matlock. 
Thrown together in September 1975 by manager Malcolm McLaren to promote Sex, his London clothing store. the Sex Pistols began mixing 1960s English pop music influences (the Small Faces, the Who) with those of 1970s rock renegades (Iggy and the Stooges, the New York Dolls). By the summer of 1976 the Sex Pistols had attracted an avid fan base and successfully updated the energies of the 1960s mods of the teenage mood of the ’70s. Heavily stylized in their image and music, media-savvy, and ambitious in their use of lyrics, the Sex Pistols became the leaders of the punk movement. Their first single, “Anarchy in the U.K.,” was both a call to arms and a state-of-the-nation address. When they used profanity on live television in December 1976 considering them as "immorral degenerate", the group became a national sensation. Scandalized in the tabloid press, the Sex Pistols were dropped by their first record company, EMI, in January 1977; their next contract, with A&M Records, was severed after only a few days in March.

 Anarchy in the UK, released as the band's debut single on 26 November 1976 and was later featured on their album Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols.

## PROG

**Progressive rock** (often shortened to prog or prog rock) is a form of rock music that evolved in the late 1960s and early 1970s as part of a "mostly British attempt to elevate rock music to new levels of artistic credibility." The term "art rock" is often used interchangeably with "progressive rock", but while there are crossovers between the two genres, they are not identical.

 Early Prog Rock drew on many sources, combining elements of Rock and Roll, Psychedelic Rock, Jazz, Folk, and Classical music. What set Prog apart was its grounding in Western symphonic tradition and its reliance on instrumental virtuosity, which had previously been considered the province of Classical and Jazz players and other “legitimate” musicians. There was nothing light or trivial about early Prog, which demanded to be taken seriously as an art form worthy of the same respect accorded to Classical music and Jazz.

Hype over this branch of rock was short-lived, spanning only from the late 60s to mid-70s. Prog Rock is often ignored because of the length of their songs. However, prog-rock bands carried on in the art of blending classical and rock music.

### Supertramp

Supertramp were an English rock band that formed in London in 1969. Marked by the individual songwriting of founders Roger Hodgson (vocals, keyboards, and guitars) and Rick Davies (vocals and keyboards), they are distinguished for blending progressive rock and pop styles.

"The Logical Song" is one of their song released as the lead single from their album Breakfast in America in March 1979.

### Pink Floyd 

Pink Floyd, British rock band at the forefront of 1960s psychedelia who later popularized the concept album for mass rock audiences in the 1970s. The principal members were lead guitarist Syd Barrett, bassist Roger Waters, drummer Nick Mason,  keyboard player Rick Wrigh and guitarist David Gilmour.

"Wish You Were Here"was recorded over numerous sessions throughout 1975 at Abbey Road Studios in London.

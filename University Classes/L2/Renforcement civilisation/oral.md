# Punk vs Prog 

## Historical Context 

70's to the 80's 

## PUNK 

**Punk**, also called punk rock, aggressive form of rock music that coalesced (merge) into an international (though predominantly Anglo-American) movement in 1975–80. Often politicized and full of vital energy beneath a sarcastic, hostile facade, punk spread as an ideology and an aesthetic approach, becoming an archetype of teen rebellion and alienation.

British punk emerged in 1976, coalescing around the Sex Pistols and spreading – virus-like – into the suburbs, provinces and cities of the UK. Almost from the outset, punk proved a contested cultural space. Its form had American provenance; its point and purpose became the subject of playground/pub/media debate ever after. 
In the UK, however, punk was born from SEX (the shop established by Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood on London’s Kings Road) and disseminated first by Sex Pistols and then by the countless groups they inspired. Punk was presented as a negation of pretty much everything. Because at the heart of the Punk movement was anger. This anger came from the problems with mainstream politics such as unemployment, racism, terrorism, union strikes and inflation. This punk movement defied all that Britain had known up until this point and took a wildly apolitical stance and going against the mainstream in shocking ways was normal on the streets of Britain in the 70's. Young people got active in the community with activities that defied the government. Many proposed a radical new way of life that doesn't involve all that British Law stood for – things like marriage or work). People began taking to the streets and part-taking in activities that were seen as deviant.

Style-wise, the clothes designed by McLaren and Westwood helped forge an aesthetic of rips, fractures and tensions, capturing perfectly the darkening mood of the 1970s. 
They would wear clothes such as Drape jackets, drainpipe trousers, work-boots and leather jackets and had their hair very short, spyky or sometimes dyed,Shocking mohawks and short, spiky,  held together by safety pins, buckles and zip fasteners.

Punk clothing and fashion was meant to be eye-catching and obscure, Grabbing your attention was the main thing punks strived for if their D.I.Y ripped clothes didn't cut it, then the accessories were the second most important thing. These include massive bulky dog collar chokers and any jewelry that feature spikes. 


### Bands

So bands like The Sex Pistols and Ramones created a fire for the British government. With their crazy stage antics, aggressive lyrics and bad language, they rebelled against everything England stands for. "rebellious subculture emerging on the fringes of British Population".

The Ramones may or may not have invented punk rock, but they were inarguably the most important band in punk history, creating the stylistic prototype that would be followed by countless bands who emerged in their wake. The original members were Joey Ramone, Johnny Ramone, Dee Dee Ramone and Tommy Ramone.

The Sex Pistols, rock group who created the British punk movement of the late 1970s and who, with the song “God Save the Queen,” became a symbol of the United Kingdom’s social and political turmoil. The original members were vocalist Johnny Rotten, guitarist Steve Jones, drummer Paul Cook, and bassist Glen Matlock. 
Thrown together in September 1975 by manager Malcolm McLaren to promote Sex, his London clothing store, the Sex Pistols began mixing 1960s English pop music influences (the Small Faces, the Who) with those of 1970s rock renegades (Iggy and the Stooges, the New York Dolls). By the summer of 1976 the Sex Pistols had attracted an avid fan base and successfully updated the energies of the 1960s mods for the malignant teenage mood of the ’70s. Heavily stylized in their image and music, media-savvy, and ambitious in their use of lyrics, the Sex Pistols became the leaders of the punk movement. Their first single, “Anarchy in the U.K.,” was both a call to arms and a state-of-the-nation address. When they used profanity on live television in December 1976 considering them as "immorral degenerate", the group became a national sensation. Scandalized in the tabloid press, the Sex Pistols were dropped by their first record company, EMI, in January 1977; their next contract, with A&M Records, was severed after only a few days in March.

## PROG

**Progressive rock** (often shortened to prog or prog rock) is a form of rock music that evolved in the late 1960s and early 1970s as part of a "mostly British attempt to elevate rock music to new levels of artistic credibility." The term "art rock" is often used interchangeably with "progressive rock", but while there are crossovers between the two genres, they are not identical.

Progressive rock bands pushed "rock's technical and compositional boundaries" by going beyond the standard rock or popular verse-chorus-based song structures. Additionally, the arrangements often incorporated elements drawn from classical, jazz, and world music. Instrumentals were common, while songs with lyrics were sometimes conceptual, abstract, or based in fantasy. Progressive rock bands sometimes used "concept albums that made unified statements, usually telling an epic story or tackling a grand overarching theme."

Progressive rock developed from late 1960s psychedelic rock, as part of a wide-ranging tendency in rock music of this era to draw inspiration from ever more diverse influences. The term was applied to the music of bands such as King Crimson, Yes, Genesis, Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull, Soft Machine and Emerson, Lake and Palmer. Progressive rock came into most widespread use around the mid-1970s. While progressive rock reached the peak of its popularity in the 1970s and early 1980s, neo-progressive bands have continued playing for faithful audiences in the subsequent decades.

Hype over this branch of rock was short-lived, spanning only from the late 60s to mid-70s. Prog Rock is often ignored because of the length of their songs. However, prog-rock bands carried on in the art of blending classical and rock music. The motivation behind progressive rock was in creating stories with complex instrumentation. The bands then added life to those stories through lyrics. Progressive rock took music as an art form seriously, which made it appear pretentious at first listen. The punk movement assertively removed prog-rock from the scene. Despite this, we see a rise in the genre again with bands like Dream Theater, Opeth, The Mars Volta, and The Flower Kings. Depending on how you classify prog-rock, Pink Floyd could be lumped in due to their innovations in music

Progressive Rock, or simply “Prog,” emerged in Britain during the late 1960s from a specific set of musical, social and technological trends. Early Prog Rock drew on many sources, combining elements of Rock and Roll, Psychedelic Rock, Jazz, Folk, and Classical music. What set Prog apart was its grounding in Western symphonic tradition and its reliance on instrumental virtuosity, which had previously been considered the province of Classical and Jazz players and other “legitimate” musicians. There was nothing light or trivial about early Prog, which demanded to be taken seriously as an art form worthy of the same respect accorded to Classical music and Jazz.

Reflecting the influence of Western Classical music, Prog albums — and sometimes even songs, such as Yes’s “Starship Trooper” (1971) — were divided into sections or movements (I. “Life Seeker”; II. “Disillusion”; III. “Würm”). A single Prog track might last 12 or 15 minutes – a far cry from the three-minute song that had long been the Pop music industry standard. Yet at the same time that it mined Classical influences, Prog drew on the 1960s counterculture and its rejection of mainstream values and explorations of alternative conceptions of identity and time.

Progressive Rock was made possible by several important technological and artistic developments. The introduction of the 33 1/3 rpm “Long Play” (LP) record in 1948 allowed for up to 30 minutes of music on each side, considerably more than the 3-5 minutes a 78 rpm disc could hold. The change enabled classical musicians to record an entire symphony on a single record. As the 60s progressed, advancements were made that culminated in growing use of multitrack recording as well as a less complex editing process. Beginning with the Beatles’ watershed 1967 album _Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band,_ many Rock bands began to conceive of albums as extended, conceptual, interconnected works rather than collections of disconnected songs.

At the same time, the rise of free-form FM radio in the United States and related programming styles in the United Kingdom allowed disc jockeys broad latitude to explore and play longer-form Rock music. In turn, advances in instrument technology, such as the invention of the Moog synthesizer, allowed for increased musical experimentation. Both would figure into the rise of Prog Rock.

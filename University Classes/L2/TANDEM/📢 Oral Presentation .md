## Introduction

Good Morning Everyone, what I'm going to talk about today is artificial intelligence. My presentation is divided in three parts, I'll start with a quick definition on what's an AI then I will look at how these AI can be useful for humankind so how they can help us in every day life next I'll take a look at what AI are bad at and why we shouldn't trust them and finally I'll make a quick conclusion.

## Definition

I believe that everyone here knows already what artificial intelligence means because it's one of the most hyped technology
of our century, and it represents 19% of companies pioneering.
But in case you don't know, it's just computers doing things that 
us as human can do but significantly faster. They can mimic, perform and improve.

Now that we've a definition in mind, you probably thinking 
" Well I already know what that meant, I've seen movies." Yes,
you've seen those movies like *Terminator* that portray AI as vilain that want to "destroy the human species". But reality, is much more fascinating and interesting than that. Like those two AI who have beaten champions at their game, I'm referring to *Alpha GO* and *Deep Blue*, the former is an AI who has beaten *Lee Sedol* at GO (Chinese abstract strategy game) and the ladder which is the most famous one, has beaten *Kasparov* at Chess. 
Or if you are more of a tech enthusiast, you know those voice assistants created by big companies like Google Home, Siri or Alexa, AI that can be quite useful and helpful. 

## How these AI can be useful for Humankind ?

In my opinion, AI was made in a goal of helping humans and make our life easier, and remove the everyday boring stuff.

During the Pandemic, many healthcare establishment decided to initiate the use of artificial intelligence in a way of helping,and
serves as an extension of the team, augmenting the capabilities of experts to be more efficient. The AI does not replace human expertise, as human feedback is a necessary part of the AI
relationship. So it's one of the examples of the growing relationship between AI and humans as a way of becoming more efficient and save much more lives.
A good example of this is the project *Neuralink* made by Elon Musk.
It's basically a chipset that will be surgically inserted into your brain so that he can analyze every brain cells and potentially save people with paralysis for example because it can make new neural connection to a bionic implant. It can also monitor our health.

AI can also be useful as a way to automate boring stuff as I said earlier, so for example in the harbours. In Rotterdam in the Netherlands, everything is autonomous. They are battery powered vehicules that are carrying and identifying containers then they will transport those containers from quayside to the container yard so that they can be deliver. They are still humans checking via cameras if everything is still working. 

AI can also be useful to make people more creative, and create much more innovative things. A good example of this is Holley Herndon, a musician and composer that made songs in collaboration with an AI called *Spawn* that she made with a team of engineers. So this AI try to recreate this abstract concept of what is music. So without any knowledge of what it is, the AI try to recreate notes, rythme, instruments. And it's quite interesting to heard his creation.

## Interruption 

To sum up what I just said, AI can be quite useful in everyday life,they can simplify, help and assists our life.

## What AI are bad at ? 

AI brain is mostly compare by scientists as an earthworm brain, so that means that they are quite stupid you might say. And yes, indeed their stupid but for a good reason. They don't know what it is to have a human point a view of things, they just achieve task via data given by their creators. 

To give you an example of that, a scientist called *Janelle Shane*, had the idea to ask an AI to made new ice cream flavour with a database of already existing flavour. So the AI try to create the next famous flavour. 
So here is the flavour that the AI came up with : Pumpkin Trash Break / Peanut Butter Slime / Strawberry Cream disease. This flavours doesn't seems very delicious, and this results was quite disappointing for Jannelle also. 

Many Scientists and well know people, like *Elon Musk* (CEO / Engineer) or *Stephen Hawking* (Scientist) have warned us about the potential danger AI can occure in the future. They can potentially become smarter than us even tho for know we don't need to worry about that. They can develop their own will and so destroy the human species and that is what we are the most scared of, because of the use of autonomous weapon in the US military for example.(Advanced Targeting and Lethality Automated System (ATLAS)). But I think we are the one who will choose what the AI for the future will be, we created it so we know what they can do.

## Conclusion 

To conclude, I will say that AI shows what humans are capable of creating, and I believe that this technology is the next big step of our evolution, the technology of tomorrow that will live in a relationship with us. And the future of AI is inspiring and promising for our next generation. Well that's it for me, Thank you for your attention and if you have any questions, I'll gladly answers them !
